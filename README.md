# SocketMe

SocketMe allows one to send personal device sensor information to a remote websocket server.

The target servers can be selected from a list.

In able to test the server you will need to run an instance of SocketMeServer.
However any websocket capable server will do.

To run the application in the browser:
```
yarn ionic:serve
```
